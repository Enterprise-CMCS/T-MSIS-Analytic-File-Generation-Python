# CMS T-MSIS Analytic File (TAF) Generation Code

This project aims to provide transparency to state Medicaid agencies and other stakeholders who are interested in the logic and processes that are used to create CMSâ€™ interim T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF). These new TAF data sets exist alongside T-MSIS and serve as an alternate data source tailored to meet the broad research needs of the Medicaid and CHIP data user community.

Background information about the TAF can be found on Medicaid.Gov at this link:

## Python Implementation of T-MSIS Analytic File (TAF) Generation for Databricks

This is a Python Library for the generation of the T-MSIS Analytic File (TAF) with distributed computing framework using Databricks.  File type(s) may be independently run within Notebooks, allowing them to be grouped into parallel processes based on state, data dependency, time interval, and T-MSIS run identifier(s).  Each process can be calibrated to optimally meet demand and deliverables. Custom Python libraries will be created to facilitate consistent management and execution of processes as well as simplify the creation of new analyses. This design is ideal for imposing best practices amongst distributed services which are appropriately granted resources and permit focus on test-driven development.

- [ ] Increment the library version number(s)
- [ ] Build the library
- [ ] Upload the WHL file to the Databricks environment
- [ ] Deploy the library to the Databricks cluster


## Increment the library version number(s)

The library version is included the source code. It can be updated in ```_init_()``` method of the TAF module.
```pytion
    __version__ = "#.#"    # set deployed library version to TAF software version, i.e. "9.0"
```

## Manual Build and Deploy (Recommended)

### Build the library

The TAF Python Library is deployed as distributable WHL ("Wheel") file. WHL files are built using [_setuptools_](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)

If not done so already, run these commands to create and set up your local virtual environment:

1. > ```python -m venv .venv```
2. > ```.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1```
3. > ```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```
4. > ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

From the top level folder, run these commands:

5. > ```rm -r -fo .\build; rm -r -fo .\*.egg-info``` (only if you have created a wheel file before)
6. > ```python setup.py bdist_wheel```


### Upload the WHL file to the Databricks environment

This step uses the Databricks UI to upload the whl file to a Volume. Volume path is listed below:

upload to Databricks prod: /Volumes/cms_prod_catalog/taf_python/taf_package_volume_prod
Upload to Databricks val: /Volumes/uat_val_catalog/taf_python/taf_package_volume_val


### Deploy the library to the Databricks cluster

Deploy the library WHL file to Databricks clusters using [these](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/cluster-libraries.html) instructions where applicable. Once the library WHL file is saved to a Volume, update any job definitions to install the library WHL file to any job-based clusters at run time.

## Automated Build and Deploy

The same steps as above are automated in the `Build and Deploy` GitHub Action in this repo.

The Action is manually triggered and currently builds the wheel, names it according to the version specified in `taf/__init__.py`, and uploads it to the dev, val, and prod buckets.

Running the `Build and Deploy` GitHub Action will post a message to the `dc-alerts` slack channel on the [DataConnect slack](dataconnect-workspace.slack.com).
