    Long-Term Care Claims (LT) TAF: The LT TAF contains information about long-term care 
    institution claims, including nursing facilities, intermediate care facility services 
    for individuals with intellectual disabilities, mental health facility services, and 
    independent (free-standing) psychiatric wings of acute care hospitals. The claims in TAF 
    include fee-for-service claims, managed care encounter claims, service tracking claims, 
    and supplemental payments for Medicaid, Medicaid-expansion CHIP, and Separate CHIP. 
    Inclusion in the LT TAF is based on the month/year of the ending date of service in 
    the claim header. Each LT TAF is comprised of two files â€“ a claim-header level file 
    and a claim-line level file. The claims included in these files are active, non-voided, 
    non-denied (at the header level), non-duplicate final action claims. Only claim header 
    records meeting these inclusion criteria, along with their associated claim line records, 
    are incorporated. Both files can be linked together using unique keys that are constructed 
    based on various claim header and claim line data elements. The two LT TAF are generated 
    for each calendar month in which the data are reported.

#   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
#   and translate a Work

#   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s)

#   iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
#   depicted in a Work

#   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
#   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below

#   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
#   a Work

#   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
#   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
#   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
#   including any amended or successor version of such directive) and

#   vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
#   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

# 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
# applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
# unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
# and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
# known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
# action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
# duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
# extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
# copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
# commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
# the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
# detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
# shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
# any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
# by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

# 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
# judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
# shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
# Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
# is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
# non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
# unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
# the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
# provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
# in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
# purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
# promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
# of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
# License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
# applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
# invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
# affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
# Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
# and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
# Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
