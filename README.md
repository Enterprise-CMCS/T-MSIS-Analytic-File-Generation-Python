This project aims to provide transparency to state
Medicaid agencies and other stakeholders who are interested in
the logic and processes that are used to create CMSâ€™ interim
T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF). These new TAF data sets exist
alongside T-MSIS and serve as an alternate data source tailored to
meet the broad research needs of the Medicaid and CHIP data user
community.
